● Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
● Internship Duration - 1 Month ( August-2021 )
● Internship Type - Work from Home

This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program )

Task1
Prediction using Supervised ML
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data

Task2
Prediction using Unsupervised ML
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task 3
Exploratory Data Analysis
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Task 4
Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

Task 5
Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’

● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.

● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.
